        <p>
            Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) is a Mexican holiday that is mainly celebrated for two days, but some traditions and preparations may extend to include October 27th and November 3rd. Día de Los Muertos
            is known for the bright <span>cempasuchil</span> (marigold) flowers. Their vibrant color and scent are believed to guide the spirits back to the world of the living.
            This celebration is time for families to honor and remember their deceased loved ones. The celebration includes building altars (ofrendas) decorated with photos, marigold flowers, candles, and favorite foods of the departed.
            People also visit cemeteries to clean and decorate graves, often spending the night there in a festive atmosphere with music and food. Day of the Dead is a holiday for celebrating death and life. It is unlike any other 
            holiday where the living and the dead come together to celebrate the memories of those who have passed away.

        <p>The tradition of Día de los Muertos has roots that go back thousands of years to indigenous practices in Mexico, particularly among the Aztec civilization. 
            The Aztecs had a month-long celebration dedicated to the goddess Mictecacihuatl, known as the "Lady of the Dead," which honored deceased ancestors. This celebration 
            took place in the ninth month of the Aztec calendar, roughly corresponding to early August in the Gregorian calendar. When Spanish colonizers arrived in the 16th century, 
            they brought with them Catholic traditions, including All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day. Over time, these indigenous and Catholic practices blended together to form the modern 
            Día de los Muertos celebration, which is now observed on November 1st and 2nd.</p>
