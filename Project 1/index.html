        <h2>Why I Love This Holiday</h2>
        <p>I love Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) because it is a beautiful celebration that honors and remembers loved ones who have passed away. 
            The vibrant colors, intricate altars, and meaningful traditions create a festive and heartfelt atmosphere. It is a time for families to come together, share stories, and celebrate the lives of those who are no longer with us.
